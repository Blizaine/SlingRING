# SlingRING

Welcome to SlingRING - an innovative, open-source web application designed to streamline and simplify the process of controlling and accessing various AI applications on your system. Built with flexibility and efficiency in mind, SlingRING is purpouse built to offer a user-friendly interface for AI app process management, logging capabilities, and URL handling, all accessible through a simple Gradio web interface.

## Features

- **Process Control:** Launch, stop, and reset your existing AI applications with ease.
- **CMD View:** Real-time remote view of CLI.
- **URL Extraction and Display:** Automatically extract and display clickable URLs from cmd/python outputs.
- **Settings Management:** Configure/Save internal and external IP addresses and port numbers for automatic URL generation.
- **Background Operations:** Update URLs and save process states periodically in the background.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Manage and monitor processes through an intuitive Gradio web interface.

## What SlingRING is NOT:


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `gradio`, `psutil`, `subprocess`, `threading`, `json`, `os`, `logging`, `time`, `re`, `sys`, `collections`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/SlingRING.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```sh
   cd SlingRING
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py

   or

   Double Click: Start.bat
   ```
2. Open the Gradio web interface as directed in the command line output.

### Configuration

- **Logs Directory:** Automatically created at first run. Contains all log files.
- **Process File:** A JSON file storing the state of running processes. Required for process managagement, specifically stop & reset. 
- **Settings File:** Manage your internal and external IP settings and port number here.  These have no baring on SlingRING itself and are only used by the URL generator to provide you a functional link.


## Precautions

### Remote Access and Security

SlingRING does not inherently provide tunneling, VPN, or remote access capabilities. Instead, it relies on the individual applications' ability to be accessed remotely. Users should be aware that each application integrated with SlingRING might support different methods of remote access. SlingRING attempts to bridge the gap that is inherrent in having different apps that support differnt protocals, but it is a work in progree. 

- **Local Network Access:** For based functionality of this application, it's recommended to set up your machine to allow local network access, to your speficied port(s) of your AI applications, for safety and control.
- **VPN for Remote Access:** For remote access, consider using a separate VPN solution. This method ensures a secure connection to your applications from outside your local network.
- **Gradio's Public URL Feature:** Some projects may utilize Gradio's feature to generate a random public URL, which remains active for 72 hours. While this is a convenient option for temporary remote access, users should be cautious about the data exposed through these public URLs.  If this is how your AI app(s) are configured, SlingRING is built to be able to parse that unique URL from the command line and present it as a clickable URL to the user. 

### Best Practices for Security

- Always ensure that your network is secured, especially when allowing remote access to applications.
- Regularly update your applications and security measures to protect against vulnerabilities.
- Be aware of the security features and limitations of each application you are managing through SlingRING.

Remember, while SlingRING facilitates the management of applications, it is the user's responsibility to ensure secure and appropriate remote access setups according to their needs and the capabilities of the individual applications.
